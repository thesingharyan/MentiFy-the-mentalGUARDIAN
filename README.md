# 🧠 MentiFy - the mentalGUARDIAN

MentiFy is an AI-powered mental wellness web application that analyzes user responses using a **fine-tuned DistilBERT** model and generates personalized mental health insights with **Google Gemini LLM**. Through guided questions and a short behavioral assessment, the system provides users with an AI-assisted mental wellness report.

---

## 🚀 System Flow

1. User answers **5 guided mental wellness questions**.
2. Each response is analyzed using a **fine-tuned DistilBERT** model.
3. The model predicts one of **7 mental health categories** for each response.
4. All responses and predictions are sent to **Google Gemini LLM**.
5. Gemini generates a personalized report including:

   * Mental wellness summary
   * Possible causes
   * Personalized recommendations
   * Healthy daily habits
   * Risk level assessment
6. The user also completes a **10-question MCQ-based behavioral assessment** for additional insights.
