🧠 MentiFy - thementalGUARDIAN

Mentify is an intelligent mental wellness web application that uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT model along with Google Gemini LLM to analyze user emotions and provide personalized mental health insights.

It collects user responses through guided questions and a short MCQ-based test, predicts mental health conditions using AI, and generates deeper suggestions using LLM-based reasoning.


🚀 System Flow
User answers 5 guided mental wellness questions
Each response is analyzed using a fine-tuned DistilBERT model
The model generates predictions for each input
All responses along with predictions are sent to Google Gemini LLM
Gemini LLM generates a detailed mental wellness report including:
Summary
Possible causes
Recommendations
Daily habits
Risk level assessment
User also completes a 10-question MCQ test for additional behavioral insight
